          <p>Firebrand Assembly of God started off small. With a few faithful and devoted members, we continued to pursue the mission of God in a shopping mall in Houston. Later, in 2007, receiving an opportunity, we purchased land and set down roots. From these humble origins came forth a church that has grown to build a community where God’s people can worship.</p>
          <h4>Our Community</h4>
          <p>Led and inspired by the Holy Spirit, we continue to reach out to the community in the neighborhood to spread God’s word and do his will. And we do it together.</p>
          <p>Firebrand Assembly of God has been blessed to have a high spirited, enthusiastic, educated, team comprising of men and women from different professions and experience. These individuals work tirelessly to ensure that the work of God is constantly in progress.</p>

          <h3 class="bckgrnd-border">What we Believe</h3>
          <p>Our faith and passion for Christianity derives from some fundamentals. This acts as a doctrine of our faith, the foundation on which we build our belief system. They are referred to the <em>“16 Fundamental Truths of the Assemblies of God”</em>. The Statement of Fundamental Truths acts as a basis of fellowship among church members.</p>
          <p>Four of these truths, Salvation, The Baptism in the Holy Spirit, Divine Healing and The Second Coming of Christ are considered Cardinal Doctrines which are essential to the church’s core mission of reaching the world for Christ. We consider the Bible our all-sufficient guide for faith and practice.</p>
          <p>Below is a paraphrased version of the 16 Fundamental Truths, derived from the official, merely meant for better understanding of our belief system:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Scriptures Inspired</h3>
          <p>Both the Old and New Testament are works that are inspired by God.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The One True God</h3>
          <p>The term “Trinity”, though not mentioned in the Scriptures, conveys the relationship of God as one being; the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit as a unified Godhead. Neither entities in the Godhead work independent of each other.</p>
          <p>The status of God, the Father is that of the begetter; the Son is the Immanuel because he is acknowledged to be both God and Man; the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and Son.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ</h3>
          <p>The Lord Jesus, the title that befits him, is the Godly in his own rights in the following way:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Fall of Man</h3>
          <p>With the creation of man in the Genesis, they were made pure of sins. But will their own transgressions and the original sin committed, have been separated by God.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Salvation of Man</h3>
          <p>The only hope of redeeming man from their sins was by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. When Jesus died for mankind, he became the Savior. By accepting the Holy Scriptures and Jesus, mankind repents for their and earns salvation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Ordinances of the Church</h3>
          <p>With Baptism by immersion in water, we declare that we have been born in Christ again, with new life, free from the original sin. And by accepting him in Communion, we acknowledge the bread and wine as a symbol of his body and blood when he died on the cross for our sins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h3>
          <p>It is essential to be ordained by the Holy Spirit for the fulfillment of God’s work. This experience of being blessed by the Holy Spirit is one different from one in Jesus’ name. With the baptism in the Holy Spirit come experiences of an overflowing fullness of the Spirit, a deepened reverence for God, an intensified dedication to His work and piety for Christ and his word.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Initial Physical Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h3>
          <p>To be baptized in the Holy Spirit means to be speaking in other tongues as guided by the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit bestows upon the believers the gift so that they can go ahead and do God’s will.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>Sanctification</h3>
          <p>To sanctify one means to make holy, free from sin. It is therefore, abandoning the works of evil and instead dedication to the work of God. By accepting the scriptures and the Holy Spirit as our guide, we accept the Christian way of life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Church and Its Mission</h3>
          <p>The church has been appointed by God to further the mission of saving mankind from sins and to be worshipped by man. Therefore it is the purpose of the church to act as an agency of God, to be the place for worship, to be a channel of God’s purpose and to accept and respond to the works of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Ministry</h3>
          <p>A group of people who have been chosen by God Himself shall be responsible to lead the church and its people to:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>Divine Healing</h3>
          <p>Deliverance from sickness and mental afflictions in the name of Jesus Christ is an essential part if the gospel. Jesus has been our Savior. To be freed from all pain (to be atoned) would be divine healing, an honor for believers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Blessed Hope</h3>
          <p>The Blessed coming is the imminent returning of Jesus Christ on Judgment Day. Till then, it remains the mission of the church to convert non believers into accepting God in their lives. It is the union of these new born believers, along with the church’s loyal following to wait in anticipation, and prepare, for the promised coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Millennial Reign of Christ</h3>
          <p>The second coming of Jesus is the blessed hope, where he shall come upon the earth with his choir of angels and establish peace. Thus, here, shall begin a time of eternal salvation. This reign of peace with him will last for a thousand years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The Final Judgment</h3>
          <p>It is written in the Book of Revelations that he who will not repent for his sins will be confined to an eternal life of doom. Only he who has followed the word of God and used it as his guide shall be allowed into Heaven. This will happen on the Day of Judgment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-list">
          <h3>The New Heavens and the New Earth</h3>
          <p>It has been promised, that those who will live by the Book will enjoy the fruits of the new world, which is Heaven; a place of righteousness and justice.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="values">
